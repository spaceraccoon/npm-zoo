### Summary

This package downloads and executes a python script from http://static.ricterz.me via preinstall, postinstall and install scripts. That script is trying to fetch and execute another script from ricterz.me:8889 which is currently down. This looks like a malicious behaviour, also it doesn't do any harm atm. The python script from http://static.ricterz.me is saved in `shell.py`.
